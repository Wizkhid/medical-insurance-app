🏥 Medical Insurance Prediction App

This is a machine learning web app built with Streamlit that predicts medical insurance charges based on user inputs (age, gender, BMI, number of children, smoking status, region, etc.).

The model is trained using a Random Forest Regressor and aims to help insurance companies estimate costs and personalize policy recommendations.

🚀 Features

User-friendly Streamlit interface.

Predicts medical insurance charges in real time.

Uses a trained Random Forest Regressor model.

Deployable on Streamlit Community Cloud.
